Overview of this project
Overview of the Basic ALU Project

This project involves designing and implementing a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog, a core component of CPUs that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU supports five basic operations: addition (ADD), subtraction (SUB), bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT. It takes two 4-bit inputs (A and B) and a 3-bit Opcode to select the operation, producing a 4-bit Result, along with Zero and Carry flags.

The ALU is designed using fundamental digital logic components: full adders for addition and subtraction, logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) for logical operations, and a multiplexer to select the correct result based on the Opcode. The design is modular and scalable, allowing for future expansion to support more operations or wider data paths.

A Verilog testbench is included to verify the ALU's functionality. It tests each operation with various inputs, including edge cases like zero results and carry-out scenarios. The testbench ensures the ALU works as expected and validates the Zero and Carry flags.

This project is ideal for learning digital logic design and Verilog programming. It provides hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and testing a fundamental hardware component. The ALU can be extended for use in more complex systems, such as microprocessors or embedded devices, and serves as a foundation for understanding CPU architecture.
